# Instruction
This GitHub file is used as a code reference for the IB3K5 group assessment (group 30) data analysis and data visualization. It consists of three parts: python code for each part of the data analysis result, two Jupyter Notebook files with all the code included and a zip file includes all the data txt.

## Python Files
There are seven Python files included:

1. `Top_Three_Locations.py`

This code is used to find the top three locations' **Purchase Amount** affected most by **Color** and write all the results into a *correlation_{location}.txt* file.

2. `Location_Category_Data.py`

This code writes the output of the Pearson Coefficient of all **Color** on **Purchase Amount**, in each specific category within each location. The result is stored in a *correlation_{Category}_{location}.txt* file and the data is used to give insight later.

3. `Highest_Count.py`

This code finds the *color* that has the most occurrences in each specific category within the top three locations. 

The result is printed by the code and will be used for the final analysis.

4. `HeatMap_Arizona.py`

This code is the visualization code to draw the heat map of Arizona.

5. `HeatMap_Kansas.py`

This code is the visualization code to draw the heat map of Kansas.

6. `HeatMap_RhodeIsland.py`

This code is the visualization code to draw the heat map of Rhode Island.

7. `Cluster.py`

This code is used to do the K-Means Clustering of **Age** and **Purchase Amount** and find which type of cluster is the most common in the top 3 cities find in `Top_Three_Locations.py`file.
The code then draw the scatter plot of the whole data, and draw the specific scatter plot for these 3 cities.

## Jupyter Notebook
`Combination_Final.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook code contains all the Python code and output result in one file which is easier to read and compare.

`Data_Cleaning.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook code contains all the Python code used for data cleaning and output result in one file which is easier to read and compare.

## Zip File
`Coefficient_Data.zip`

This is a zip file included all the output txt file generated by code `Top_Three_Locations.py` and `Location_Category_Data.py`.
(The data in these files are the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of **Color** on **Purchase Amount**) 

## Cautions
The data we analyze is **CustomerShoppingTrends.xlsx**.
In the python file `Top_Three_Locations.py`, `Location_Category_Data.py`, `Highest_Count.py` and `Cluster.py`.

The code used is :
`data = pd.read_excel('/Users/mac/Desktop/IB3K5/CustomerShoppingTrends.xlsx')`

However, *'/Users/mac/Desktop/IB3K5/CustomerShoppingTrends.xlsx'* is a custom path depends on the real path of the Excel on the users' local space, it may need to be changed based on the users' situation.
